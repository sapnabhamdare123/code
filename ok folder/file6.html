Typography is the art of arranging letters, and is seen on screens, paper, and signs all around us. With typography you can change the look and feel of words or phrases by using different styles of letters to say different things. Like people, they have different personalities. For example, thick bold lines can be loud and thin cursive lines are soft and quiet. How we present these words becomes just as much a part of the message as the words themselves. In this activity, we are using different mediums that can be used in typography, such as stamps, stickers, magazine cut outs and letter drawing. Like Jae, we will use our voices to put a positive message out into the world!

        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
